<sup id="1">**1**</sup> A "support server" can be any of:

- Website
- Subreddit or other forum
- Discord/Guilded server
- *others may be accepted; if in doubt, try it, and you'll be asked to change it if it's a problem*

<sup id="2">**2**</sup> We define a "skid" as:

> taking others code and passing it off as your own and not crediting the original work

Please note that a skid should **not** be confused with a [port] or a [fork]. Some mods may include the term "skid" in their title, but this is not an official indicator of a skid.
